// This code snippet is defining an enum called `eTypeRecord` with the following constants: `TEXT`,
// `AUDIO`, `STARTED_CONNECTION`, `CALL`, `GROUP`, and `RECEIVED`. Enums in Java are used to define a
// fixed set of constants. In this case, `eTypeRecord` is defining different types of records that can
// be used in the application, such as text, audio, connection started, call, group, and received
// records.
